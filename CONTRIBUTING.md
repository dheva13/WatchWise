# Contributing to WatchWise

Thanks for your interest in contributing! Here’s how to help:

## Getting started
- Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`.
- If you’ve added code that needs a config, update `README.md` and `config.example.js`.
- Make sure your code is readable and consistent with the existing style.

## Development
- Use any static server (see README) to run locally.
- Keep functions small and well-named. Add guards for edge cases.

## Commit messages
- Prefer clear, imperative messages (e.g., "Add search error handling").

## Pull requests
- Describe the change and the motivation.
- Include before/after screenshots if the UI changed.
- Ensure no secrets are committed (e.g., `config.js`).

## Reporting issues
- Search existing issues first.
- Include reproduction steps, expected vs actual behavior, and environment details.
